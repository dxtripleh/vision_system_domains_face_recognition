### üèõÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

#### 1. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- **Rationale**: Complex business logic requires clear separation of concerns
- **Benefits**: Better maintainability, testability, and domain understanding
- **Trade-offs**: Higher initial complexity, more files to manage

#### 2. Hexagonal Architecture
- **Rationale**: Need to support multiple interfaces (API, CLI) and storage options
- **Benefits**: Easy to swap implementations, better testing isolation
- **Trade-offs**: More abstraction layers

#### 3. ONNX Runtime for Inference
- **Rationale**: Cross-platform compatibility and performance
- **Benefits**: Works on CPU/GPU, consistent across platforms
- **Trade-offs**: Additional dependency, some model conversion required

#### 4. InsightFace Model Suite
- **Rationale**: State-of-the-art accuracy and proven performance
- **Benefits**: High accuracy, multiple model options, active community
- **Trade-offs**: Larger model sizes, non-commercial license restrictions

### üîê Security Considerations

#### Data Protection
- Face embeddings are anonymized by default
- Personal information is encrypted at rest
- GDPR compliance features implemented

#### Model Security
- Model file integrity checking
- Secure model download with checksum validation
- Protection against adversarial attacks (planned)

### üöÄ Future Roadmap

#### Version 1.1.0 (Planned)
- [ ] TensorRT optimization for NVIDIA GPUs
- [ ] Face anti-spoofing detection
- [ ] Real-time video processing pipeline
- [ ] Model quantization for edge devices

#### Version 1.2.0 (Planned)

- [ ] Advanced privacy-preserving techniques
- [ ] Distributed processing capabilities

### üêõ Known Issues

#### Current Limitations
1. **Memory Usage**: Large models require significant GPU memory
2. **Cold Start**: Initial model loading takes time
3. **Batch Processing**: Limited batch size on consumer GPUs
4. **Model Licensing**: Some models restricted to non-commercial use

#### Workarounds
1. Use lightweight models for memory-constrained environments
2. Implement model warming strategies
3. Adjust batch sizes based on available memory
4. Consider alternative models for commercial use
